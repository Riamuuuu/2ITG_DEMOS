                    <h3> What is fake news?</h3>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            The word fake news starts with someone spreading a message on social media. But, someone noticed in the message 
                            that they did not agree with what was written. First read an article or news that is true and in the original 
                            post before they spread it to people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because of the rising popularity of online social media, fake news—including false information, reviews, advertising, 
                            rumors, political remarks, satires, and more—is increasingly being distributed online. Nowadays, fake news is more prevalent 
                            and frequently disseminated on social media than in traditional media. Fake news has grown to be a serious concern for both 
                            business and academia since it is frequently used to mislead and influence online users with skewed information. Additionally, 
                            a great deal of unbelievable and false material is produced and distributed online, which poses a risk to online social networks 
                            and has a detrimental effect on activities like social networking and online purchasing.

                                <h3> How to spot fake news?</h3>
                                <br>
                                    <p>
                                        Assessing the veracity of a particular item of news is the task of false news detection, to put it simply (Vlachos & Riedel, 2014). 
                                        Additionally, the resources now available for identifying false news can be divided into two groups: (1) practical detection techniques 
                                        from the viewpoint of Internet consumers; and (2) current research-based detection techniques from the viewpoint of academics and research. 
                                        Additionally, we largely cover the practical-based method for identifying bogus news online in this section.
                                        <br></br>
                                        Resources for fact-checking are frequently used by mainstream media outlets. Real-time news is often a mixture of facts, therefore sometimes 
                                        the overall issue cannot be properly explained by a binary classification result. In the most recent fact-checking resources, a wide range of 
                                        evaluation criteria or visual metrics are used to assess the news's level of veracity.
                                        <br>
                                        Don't stop at the headline: In fake news, the headlines are always outrageous and attention-grabbing to entice readers to click. The news 
                                        story's actual content might have nothing to do with the headlines or even go against the facts stated in the headlines. It's a good idea 
                                        to read the entire article before making any judgments about any dubious online information rather than just reading the headline. In order 
                                        to persuade readers, news writers always include a wealth of facts, including the opinions of experts, some statistical or survey data, 
                                        supporting documents, references, and even external links. Spend some time reading those supplementary materials because they may aid Internet 
                                        users in determining the veracity of the news's claims. Another way is to see if the news source is from a well-known or obscure web address? 
                                        Even lexical properties of the URL, such as the presence of suspicious tokens or unusual domain names (like ".com.co"), can be used to identify 
                                        malicious websites. The "About Us" or "Disclaimer" section of a website occasionally provides helpful information about the page and can be regarded as a sign of legitimacy.

                                                   Fake news could start from any one of us. Yes, we are all capable of that. It could start as a lie or a prank from one person and end up 
                                                   being misinformation and one person who hears the conversation will tell it to the others and the cycle goes on and yes, there's a lot of 
                                                   factors where fake news can be created. Before being broadly visible throughout the internet, it is typically begins in tiny, reliable group. 
                                                   These might include social media pages, facebook groups or groups on messaging applications like a family chat or a group chat.
                                                   <br></br>
                                                   And by that, we all know that we trust the people around us or we trust the people who are always together with, so when they provide us information
                                                   or if they send something to us that might be a "fake news", we are more or less to believe them and then sometimes we send it to others as well since
                                                   we trust that person, and that's how the exhange of fake news can circulate among us.
                                                   <br></br>
                                                   We are now living in a world where internet is a necessity, "we can't live without internet" they might say, however what if this necessity could actually
                                                   harm us? There are lots of type of outlets or medias that can be source of fake news so please beware. We cannot find fake news from an article, fake news 
                                                   could actually be from videos circulating online, from pictures, from memes or from you trusted person. One click and you can now spread misinformation within a second
                                                   and you can actually harm someone from that doing and yes, we are all capable of that so please be careful and be mindful of the things you share online.
